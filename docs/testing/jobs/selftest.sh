# The jobs' self-test: run the real job scripts against a fake host.
#
#   docs/testing/jobs/selftest.sh          # exits non-zero on any failure
#
# WHY. The jobs run only on the owner's host -- systemd, gh, adb, the
# dispatch directory, the goldens tree -- and the session that writes them
# cannot execute any of it. On 2026-09-19 that put the owner in a loop:
# merge, run, paste the error, wait for the fix, merge again. Three of the
# four defects that day (a watermark seeded at install time, an arithmetic
# error on a "?" field, an empty --runs handed to request.sh) fall out of
# one run of this file. So: nothing under jobs/ is pushed until this passes,
# and the check is in CI (.github/workflows/jobs-selftest.yml) as well.
#
# WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS FAKED. Real: git, python3, request.sh's whole
# queue path (its gates, its JSON writer), arms.sh, fold.sh, cloud.sh,
# status.sh. Faked, as shims on PATH under $T/bin: gh (canned answers, every
# call logged), systemctl, systemd-run, adb. The goldens tree is generated
# from the prediction under test, so request.sh's every-key-must-bind gate
# runs for real.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- the checks
# Every check lives in its own file under selftest.d/, sourced here in sorted
# order with everything above already built: $T, $HERE, $REPO, the shims on
# PATH, ok/bad/check, the live prediction and its goldens.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT ONE FILE. This is the gate every change under jobs/ must pass,
# so a lane that fixes something here also adds the check that proves it: on
# 2026-09-19 nine harness lanes ran and all nine appended to this file. The
# fold job folds one PR per tick and each fold moves master, so the conflict
# rate on this one path was not high, it was ~100% -- two of the first three
# folds attempted were handed back on selftest.sh alone, each costing a full
# lane.sh resume to re-land work that was already finished and green. A
# fragment is separately ownable; two lanes adding checks now touch two paths.
#
# ADDING A CHECK: write, or edit, selftest.d/NN-<concern>.sh.
#   - NN is exactly two digits. A three-digit prefix would sort before every
#     two-digit one, so the loop below refuses a name that is not NN-*.sh
#     rather than silently never sourcing it.
#   - The number fixes the order, and order matters: fragments 10..50 drive
#     arms.sh over one shared dispatcher queue in sequence, and 60 reads what
#     they left. Each fragment's header says what it depends on.
#   - Fragments are sourced, not executed: no shebang, no exit. `pass`, `fail`
#     and the fixtures are shared state, so a failing check in a fragment
#     fails the whole run, which is the point.
