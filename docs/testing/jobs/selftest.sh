# The jobs' self-test: run the real job scripts against a fake host.
#
#   docs/testing/jobs/selftest.sh          # exits non-zero on any failure
#
# WHY. The jobs run only on the owner's host -- systemd, gh, adb, the
# dispatch directory, the goldens tree -- and the session that writes them
# cannot execute any of it. On 2026-09-19 that put the owner in a loop:
# merge, run, paste the error, wait for the fix, merge again. Three of the
# four defects that day (a watermark seeded at install time, an arithmetic
# error on a "?" field, an empty --runs handed to request.sh) fall out of
# one run of this file. So: nothing under jobs/ is pushed until this passes,
# and the check is in CI (.github/workflows/jobs-selftest.yml) as well.
#
# WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS FAKED. Real: git, python3, request.sh's whole
# queue path (its gates, its JSON writer), arms.sh, fold.sh, cloud.sh,
# status.sh. Faked, as shims on PATH under $T/bin: gh (canned answers, every
# call logged), systemctl, systemd-run, adb. The goldens tree is generated
# from the prediction under test, so request.sh's every-key-must-bind gate
# runs for real.
