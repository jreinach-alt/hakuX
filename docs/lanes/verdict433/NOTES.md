# lane.verdict433 notes

Measurement pass for #433 (50 Playable): find the titles closest to the bar
and give each one what its verdict still lacks.

## The rule, as the tools apply it

- `title_verdict.py` with `targets.toml` `[defaults]`: `playable_fps` 30 with
  `fps_tolerance` 0.95, so a window counts at 28.5 fps or more. `fps_share_min`
  is 0.90 of gameplay *time*. `audio_starve_max_share` is 0.001. Screening is
  600 s and confirmation 1200 s after `mark gameplay`. The run needs no hang
  (10 s with fewer than 60 flips) and no crash.
- **The status page counts a title as Playable only on a passing
  `pass_kind: confirmation` verdict** (`status_html.py` `titles05`, the
  `soaked` list). So every candidate needs a 1200 s confirmation, whatever its
  screening says.
- The confirmation regimen is the device's defaults, `--env PERF_REGIMEN=default`
  (owner, #433, 2026-09-27). A thermal pause at the defaults fails the run
  (`thermal.failed_sustained`), where at MAX it voids the run. sustain507
  (#433, 2026-09-28) found every Thor run of Crimson, GTA SA and MA2 paused
  within 5-8 min from a 58-65 C start. A heavy title on the Thor is expected
  to fail its confirmation on heat, and that counts as its verdict.

## The status page's fps overstates the tier A titles

The title table's fps and share come from a 90-240 s slice of each soak
(`_soak_read`), not from the whole scored window. I copied the inputs of each
title's newest route soak to a scratch dir (`judge_copy.py`, which writes no
verdict into the live results) and ran `title_verdict.py` over the full
gameplay:

Tier B, same method:

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crimson Skies | nova | 1790467160-titlebench-2612149 | 308 | 85.0% | under 90% |

## Ranking (probability x win; every win is one Playable title)

1. **Azurik (Thor), the pilot.** It is clean on the route, and it has the
   Thor's thermal risk. It is the one confirmation that fits the 30-min gate
   (1480 s + 90 s). Queued: `1-1790688705-lane.verdict433-3467502`.
2. **Baldur's Gate DA (Thor), WWE Raw 2 (Nova), 50 Cent (Nova).** Each was
   100% or near it with no hang. The Nova ones have no heat risk on record, so
   these have the highest probability of passing. See `queue_batch1.sh`.
3. **KOF MI (Thor).** The fps passes; audio was 0.38% short against a 0.1%
   bar. It is in batch 1 because a 20-min run settles whether that shortfall
   holds or came from a burst.
4. **RalliSport 2.** It paused at MAX within 2 min on the Thor. At the defaults
   that pause fails the run. Next: a Nova screening on the returning route,
   after the Nova's charge hold lifts, if the Nova's title state has the
   profile.
5. **Tier B** (Crimson, Ghoulies, Blinx 2 and the rest) reads 73-87% at the
   bar on the full window. A confirmation of any of them is expected to fail
   the share. Leave them until a fix moves their fps.
6. **Tier C** (DOA Ultimate, AUF, Forza, GTA SA). Other lanes' arms on these
   titles are queued (gmem474, forzadecay414, litcompile569, uberspike569).
   Re-measure them after those arms land, and after #583 folds for Forza.

## Running table (confirmations)

## State at the end of session 1 (2026-09-29, about 07:00 PDT)

Waiting on the pilot `1-1790688705-lane.verdict433-3467502`. It sits behind
about 2 h of 1- requests on the Thor. When `results/<id>/DONE` exists:
1. Run `title_verdict.py <dir> --require confirmation`.
2. Read `thermal.first_pause_s`, and the frames from `route-frames/`.
3. Write `pilots/lane.verdict433.ok` with `python3`.
4. Run `queue_batch1.sh`.

## Tools here

- `scan.py PATTERN...` lists every verdict.json in the live results for matching titles.
- `soaks.py PATTERN...` lists every finished soak for matching ISOs, with the
  time from `soak start` to `mark gameplay` (this sets `--seconds`).
- `judge_copy.py OUTDIR ID...` judges a copy of a result's inputs. Use it for
  any benchmark you only want to read. Running `title_verdict.py` on the live
  dir would write a failing short verdict that the status page then shows.
- `queue_batch1.sh` holds the next four confirmations. Queue it after the
  pilot review.

## For the next lane

- Do not trust the status page's fps column for a Playable call. Judge the
  full window.
- Lane pilots can hold only one confirmation, because 1200 s plus the route
  plus 90 s of setup comes to 25-31 min against the 30-min gate. Pick a
  pilot whose route marks gameplay early.
