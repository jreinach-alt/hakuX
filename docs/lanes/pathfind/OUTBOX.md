[lane.pathfind] pathfind.py is running unattended on real titles. First lot-drawn title:
**Star Wars Episode III (Nova): gameplay confirmed in 3.5 min, 17 model calls (16 Haiku, 1 Sonnet for the
confirmation), 18 steps.** Path: 3 logos/title skipped with START, the opening crawl and a long FMV (START
ignored, it waited them out), first gameplay frame "NEW OBJECTIVE: ESCAPE THE CRUISER HANGAR"; the stick
probe moved Obi-Wan (frames checked by eye too). Frame: `docs/lanes/pathfind/runs/star-wars-iii/strip.jpg`.
Side finding: this title's intro FMV renders as green blocks (a video decode/rendering defect).
Model step latency via `claude -p`: 8-10 s per Haiku call, ~$0.027. Next: the other 9 lot titles on the
Nova (running now), ESPN NFL 2K5 on the Thor (running now).
