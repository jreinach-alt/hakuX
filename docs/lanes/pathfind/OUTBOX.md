[lane.pathfind] pathfind.py is running unattended on real titles. First lot-drawn title:
**Star Wars Episode III (Nova): gameplay confirmed in 3.5 min, 17 model calls (16 Haiku, 1 Sonnet for the
confirmation), 18 steps.** Path: 3 logos/title skipped with START, the opening crawl and a long FMV (START
ignored, it waited them out), first gameplay frame "NEW OBJECTIVE: ESCAPE THE CRUISER HANGAR"; the stick
probe moved Obi-Wan (frames checked by eye too). Frame: `docs/lanes/pathfind/runs/star-wars-iii/strip.jpg`.
Side finding: this title's intro FMV renders as green blocks (a video decode/rendering defect).
Model step latency via `claude -p`: 8-10 s per Haiku call, ~$0.027. Next: the other 9 lot titles on the
Nova (running now), ESPN NFL 2K5 on the Thor (running now).

[lane.pathfind] Scoreboard 2/2 on the Nova lot so far. **Midnight Club 3 (Nova): gameplay confirmed in
6.2 min, 33 model calls** (Career -> buy a car -> Test Drive -> driving in the city; RT moved the car).
Frame: `docs/lanes/pathfind/runs/midnight-club-3/gameplay_frame.jpg`. Running now: Bruce Lee, then
Black Stone, Panzer Dragoon Orta, Amped 2, Counter-Strike, Top Spin, Ninja Gaiden Black, Spikeout.
Changes from what was learned: the d-pad is the hat axis (the d-pad buttons do nothing in hakuX), inline
images and Sonnet 5 per step (3.5-3.9 s vs Haiku's 6-9 s, measured), Opus 5.5 when stuck, a 2-screen cycle
detector. ESPN NFL 2K5 (Thor) reached the kickoff twice in 3.3 min but the Thor heat-stopped at 70 C both
times (52 -> 70 C in 3.6 min of menus); retrying from a cold start.
